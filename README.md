# discord2groupme
With the power of monkeys and typewriters, anything is possible no matter how badly it's coded.

1. Make a groupme bot and a discord bot

2. Make a discord webhook to the channel you want messages to be posted to

3. Edit config.json with...

- The token of your discord bot
- the id of your groupme bot
- your discord ID, so your own sent messages don't get posted back to the groupme chat.
- the discord channel id you want the discord bot to listen on, which should be the same as the webhook you're posting to.
- the URL of your discord webhook.
- Your groupme user ID so all other messages are ignored. (Currently the link is designed for one person in groupme, although it's very possible for more.)
